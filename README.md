# Scooter
Scooter is a game used at the monthly PEI Developers meetup to help us pick winners of our door prizes. This version is the angular js port of the original dojo version of scooter

Version 0.1 Beta

#Usage
To run the application you need to have the code running on a server. Most IDE's have a server built in that you can run the application from there during development. Others using text editors may choose to use something like the python simple http server.

Here is an example of running the code from the pythin simple http server (assuming python is installed) which will server from port 8000
```
$ cd /home/workspace/Scooter
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
or for python3 
```
python3 -m http.server
```
